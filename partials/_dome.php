	<h2>Dome</h2>
    <p class="indent">
        I built the dome first, because I considered it the most critical and outstanding feature.  I used a jig to ensure that each of the eight rafters was exactly the same size and shape.  I fashioned a cardboard template to size the plywood sheathing over the dome.  The shape and size was just sufficient to permit a nice bend of the plywood.  At the top, I used a four piece slotted connector to join each of the eight rafters and provide stability to the entire structure.  Each rafter was comprised of eleven pieces, each of the eight dome sides has 5 lateral braces and the center support has 12 pieces that lock together, which totals to 156 pieces for the dome alone.

        I think the dome and its capital really accentuate the overall design and look great.  It may be that the triangle shape of a dome is very strong and with the eight sides it should be resistant to high winds.
