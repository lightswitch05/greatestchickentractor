	<h2>Wheels</h2>
    <p class="indent">
        Any tractor should have wheels, so we use swivel casters.  Like the feeder/waterier we are on design version 2.0, as the initial pulleys and wheels were too small.  As the casters are raised with cables the whole chicken tractor lifts to its full upright position.  It rolls very easily and smoothly with the initial wheels when it was in my basement on a flat concrete floor, but in the real world of grass, dirt, and unevenness larger wheels and stronger cables, pulleys, and cable clamps were necessary.  The cable from each wheel/corner runs through pulleys to a winch enclosed in its own alcove on the "starboard" side.  Crank in the cables with the winch and the whole tractor rises for its next movement, forward, sideways and both.  We generally move it once a week to keep the grass alive and the scratching dust holes to a reasonable size.  If one has a yard that is secure from all predators coming from both land and sky (don't ignore the hawks and owls) then perhaps a chicken tractor is not necessary, but on my acreage I have no such assurance and desired the mobility and security provided by a chicken tractor.  It is this security that is incorporated into this design and eliminates the need for an automatic opening and closing coup door.
