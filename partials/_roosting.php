	<h2>Roosting</h2>
    <p class="indent">
        There are two sets of roosting poles because I could not get sufficient room out of one, but the facing chambers make a nice arrangement should there be any differences of opinion among the hens that are not easily reconciled.  Perhaps this arrangement facilitates both the conservative and liberal thinkers in the poultry society.  Moreover, I have observed differences in age or size or breed that may welcome some degree of separation from time to time.  The yellow on top the poles is some yellow duct tape I applied to increase their comfort and grip on the electric PVC poles.
