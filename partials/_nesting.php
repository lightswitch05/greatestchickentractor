	<h2>Nesting Boxes</h2>
    <p class="indent">
        The nesting boxes are where the hens lay their eggs.  I found it very interesting that hens will share nesting boxes and actually prefer to do so.  This design incorporates easy exterior access to the nesting boxes as the outer-side opens on a hinged bottom and there is a latch at the top for security. Occasionally, you could open the door and find a hen on the nest, simply close it and look in another box.  On occasion there could be eggs in multiple boxes.  The interior is approximately 12 inches square with about 18 inches of head room.  I think the hens prefer a raised nesting box, but that idea did not fit with my design, but I did include a 4 inch threshold to keep the hay nest inside and provide a separation between the coup and the nesting boxes.  Young hens or those new to a certain coup may initially lay eggs anywhere, but eventually they will find and prefer the nesting boxes.

        The five sided roofs required the plywood to be bent to its maximum angle so I applied water to the surface before the bend and this inhibited cracking and splintering.  There are three separate "alcoves" containing four nesting boxes a feed reservoir and a water supply reservoir.  Each alcove has five sides and contains two rooms separated by a plywood divider that can be removed through the center door when opened, (I have some screws holding it shut as it will rarely be opened).  I included this feature so that a total cleaning, repair, or floor replacement could be made, if ever necessary.
