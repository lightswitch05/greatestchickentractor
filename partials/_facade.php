	<h2>Facade</h2>
    <p class="indent">
        The faade incorporates three large doors for clean out and access to the Chicken Tractor.  I added a round window over the access door for esthetics and to potentially limit damage from high winds.  The windows are made from aluminum flashing that has been formed into a conical section then cut, folded, riveted, and fastened to wood rings to form a nice round inset shape, similar to those used on the Duomo in Florence Italy.  The access doors on both side of the coup permit the easy removal of waste, supply with fresh straw, and interior access whenever required.   The access door on the end of the run needed a fitting and elegant design, as well as sufficient strength to support the weight of the run and end wheels.
